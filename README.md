# Sketchpad Project

This project builds a simple sketchpad that can be painted using your mouse and cleared/resized by pressing buttons.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/sketchpad.git
$ cd sketchpad
$ xdg-open index.html
```

To exit out of the session in the command line, press CTRL+C.

## Pre-Project Thoughts

Take note at this point I only have basic Javascript and jQuery skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

It turned out pretty OK!
One thing the page is definitely missing is responsive design and a nicer presentation.
I definitely need to refine my CSS skills to produce better looking webpages.
